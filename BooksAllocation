Allocate minimum pages:- 
                       Minimise the maximum numbers of pages read by a students.
                       constraint :- book distribute in continue way and every student need to read the book by their own.
                                     not spliting book.
                       
                       Using Broute Force:- Time Complexity O (2^n)
                                            We divide the list in two parts and consider all the possibility to divide books between k numbers
                                            of students recursively.
                       
                       
                       Using Binary Search:- Time Complexity O (nlogn), Space Complexity O (1)
                                             Array is not sorted but we using binary search because we need to allocate book in continouse way.
                                             
                                             Example:-
                                                      a = [10, 5, 20]
                                                      
                                                      def minPages(a: List[int], k: int):

                                                           max = sum(a)

                                                           return res
                                                           
                                                      def isFeasible(a: List[int], k: int, res):
